# justchat-devcom
This is the repository for a chat app I built using Angular and [AngularFire](https://github.com/angular/angularfire) with Cloud Firestore as the back-end.

For deploying locally, you will have to install all the modules I used in making this web-app. For this run `npm install` in the cloned project directory. The app will be deployed on `http://localhost:4200/` after executing `ng serve` or `ng s` in the same directory.
Make sure for an active internet connection as I have used a cloud service for the database.

I have also deployed this app on Firebase, so you can check this [https://justchat-amansingh.firebaseapp.com/] out. This site is a bit slow so you will have to be a bit more patient while it loads and also reload the page if it is blank.
