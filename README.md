This is the repository for a chat app I built using Angular and AngularFire with Cloud Firestore as the back-end.

For deploying locally, you will have to install all the modules I used in making this web-app. For this run `npm install` in the project directory. The app will be deployed on `http://localhost:4200/` after executing `ng serve` or `ng s` in the same directory.

I have also deployed this app on Firebase, so you can check this [https://justchat-amansingh.firebaseapp.com/] out.
